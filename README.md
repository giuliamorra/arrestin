# rotation angle

This project involves the calculation of the rotation angle of a 3D point around a given axis. Input is given by the coordinates of the axis (i.e. two 3D positions, file "axis.dir.dat" ) and by the trajectory of the point (file "angle.series.dat"). The latter can e.g. be the center of mass of a protein domain.
the code is myrotation.c
